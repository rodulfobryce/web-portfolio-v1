                    <h4>Internship Description</h4>
                    <p>The internship introduced me to OutSystems, a low-code platform unfamiliar to me. Despite initial struggles, I used online courses and documentation to understand its fundamentals, particularly CRUD operations and workflows. My work combined testing and development, offering insights into the application and user experience. The project was large-scale, with complex functionalities requiring critical thinking and adaptability. The team provided guidance and support, creating an environment where I could learn and contribute meaningfully.</p>

                    <h4>Experience</h4>
                    <p>This internship was a challenging yet rewarding experience that pushed me to learn new tools and adapt to a professional environment. I felt like an integral team member rather than just an intern, gaining valuable skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and system analysis. However, I realized the need for more hands-on learning in school, as academic knowledge alone was insufficient for real-world tasks. To better prepare students, I suggest integrating two internships: one early for workplace exposure and another later to refine industry readiness.</p>
