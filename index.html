                    <p>The internship introduced me to OutSystems, a low-code platform unfamiliar to me. Despite initial struggles, I used online courses and documentation to understand its fundamentals, particularly CRUD operations and workflows. My work combined testing and development, offering insights into the application and user experience. The project was large-scale, with complex functionalities requiring critical thinking and adaptability. The team provided guidance and support, creating an environment where I could learn and contribute meaningfully.</p>

                    <h4>Experience</h4>
                    <p>This internship was a challenging yet rewarding experience that pushed me to learn new tools and adapt to a professional environment. I felt like an integral team member rather than just an intern, gaining valuable skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and system analysis. However, I realized the need for more hands-on learning in school, as academic knowledge alone was insufficient for real-world tasks. To better prepare students, I suggest integrating two internships: one early for workplace exposure and another later to refine industry readiness.</p>

        <div class="reflection-details">
           <p>As I approach the end of my college journey, I am able to reflect on the many experiences that have shaped my growth and development. My degree has provided me with a strong foundation in both technical and soft skills, preparing me for the challenges of the professional world. I have gained a deep understanding of various technologies and their real-world applications, while also honing my critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork abilities.</p>
        <p>Through a combination of academic coursework, extracurricular activities, and hands-on internships, I’ve had the opportunity to apply what I’ve learned in practical settings. These experiences have not only expanded my technical knowledge but also allowed me to develop important skills such as collaboration, communication, and adaptability.</p>
        <p>As I move forward, I am confident in the skills I’ve acquired and excited for the opportunities that lie ahead. The lessons learned during my time in college have been invaluable in preparing me for a career in the ever-evolving field of technology. I look forward to continuing to grow, learn, and contribute to the industry. I also do believe that school is just a surface level and it is not much compared to when we get into the industry. There are far more standards, processes, and much more to expect after we graduate. And I believe that I myself should continue to learn consistently after school by exploring the things I enjoy in my degree.</p>
